# Snake: Learning Python for Kids
## HYL Hackathon 2022: Begineers' Stream
Our project is an interactive, multi-level game that introduces kids to the basics of Python coding language, inspired by the infamous Snake Game. In order to obtain The Certificate of Completion, the user has to overcome challenges testing their knew knowledge of print functions, strings, integers, and operators. The main goal of the games is to help the snake retrieve the apple in the field. Once the python retrives the apple, the user unlocks new lessons. They will have to use what was taught in the lesson to help the snake catch the apple, making it more challenging as they progress to higher levels.

## How We Built It
We used PyGame and VSCode to create the code for our program and a run.bat file to make the Python file executable. Canva played a large role in creating all the graphics displayed on the game.

## How to Play it
1. Download all GitHub files into a folder
2. Open in VSCode
3. Create a run.bat file
4. In the file, paste "python compile-updated.py" into the first line
5. In the command terminal, type ".\run.bat" and press enter
